For this challenge, we will complete the code below to classify images of dogs and cats. We will use Tensorflow 2.0 and Keras to create a convolutional neural network that correctly classifies images of cats and dogs at least 63% of the time.

Some of the code is given to us but some code we must fill in to complete this challenge. Let's read the instruction in each text cell so we will know what you have to do in each code cell.

The first code cell imports the required libraries. The second code cell downloads the data and sets key variables. The third cell is the first place we will write your own code.
